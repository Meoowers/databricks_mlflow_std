# Models for Databricks and MLFLOW testing


Repo for sync ML/MLOPS Databricks stuff (for testing), using mlflow and pyspark.

You can change the models and register models and configs in Unity Catalog here, but to access the env directly in Databricks, please contact [Sophia Katze](mailto:sophia.helena.paula@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Databricks%20MLflow).
